Write  a  program  that  reads  in  an  integer  entered  by  the  user  (in  between  2  and  1000)  and 
determines  if the  integer is prime. If  it  is NOT prime,  just report a proper divisor of the number 
less than 1 and end the program. If the number entered is prime, list out each primitive root of the 
prime number in between 2 and the number minus one, in numerical order. 

Sample run:
Enter n.
143
143 is not prime. It's smallest non-trivial divisor is 11.
